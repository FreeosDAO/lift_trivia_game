# Lift Cash Trivia

## Overview

A trivia application with scheduled rounds that start automatically every 3 hours. Players must authenticate using Internet Identity before they can join a lobby, select their language, indicate readiness, and are automatically transitioned into the game when the round begins. After each round ends, all players return to the lobby with cleared readiness status and must explicitly re-join for the next round by selecting their language and clicking **Ready** again.

## Design System

The application uses a dark theme with the following design specifications:

* **Dark backgrounds:** `#121212` (main areas), `#1e1e1e` (cards and components)
* **Text colors:** white and gray variations for readability
* **Primary accent color:** orange `#EB5528` replacing all blue accents
* **Typography:** Inter (body), Montserrat (headings h1‚Äìh6)
* **Card layouts:** 16px rounded corners, subtle shadows, hover lift effects
* **Buttons:** depth styling, orange accent, hover animations
* **Form inputs:** dark backgrounds with orange focus states
* **Gradient text effects** for main titles
* **Responsive design:** mobile breakpoint at `768px`
* **CSS variables** defined in `:root` for consistent theming

* Use the logo consistently across all pages and relevant UI components.
* Ensure logo styling matches the dark theme design system.

### Trivia Game Flow

When a round starts, present each player with a series of **10 timed multiple-choice questions**:

* Each question has four answer options (A, B, C, D) with one correct answer.
* Questions are pulled from the Lift Cash trivia content library and localized to the player's chosen language.
* For each question, display:

  * Question text
  * Four answer buttons (A, B, C, D)
  * Countdown timer (15 seconds per question)
  * Current question number (e.g., ‚ÄúQuestion 3 of 10‚Äù)
  * Hint button or Rocket icon that reveals the hint text when clicked
* Automatically advance to the next question when an answer is selected or time runs out.
* Lock in the player‚Äôs answer (no changing or going back).
* Track each player's answers and compute their total correct answers throughout the round.
* **Do not display the score** until the end of the round.
* Ensure all players answer the same set of questions in their respective languages.
* UI updates automatically as questions progress.
* All game elements styled with dark theme design system and logo branding.
* If a round does not have questions available, display a message informing players and prompt them to come back later.
* After the last question (including bonus questions, if any), automatically return the player to the lobby screen.

### Round End and Reset

* When a round ends (after the last question including bonus questions), automatically return all players to the lobby screen.
* **Clear all player readiness status onchain** for all players, ensuring no one is automatically joined for the next round.
* Require all players to explicitly select their language and click **Ready** again for each new round.
* No automatic carry-over of readiness status between rounds.
* Ensure the frontend reflects the cleared readiness status when players return to the lobby.
* After readiness status is cleared, players can immediately select their language and click **Ready** to join the next round without any blocking or restrictions.

### Scheduled Round Management

* Rounds start automatically every 3 hours at fixed times (e.g., 12:00, 3:00, 6:00, 9:00).
* At the scheduled start time, automatically begin the round for all authenticated players who are marked as ready.
* Transition players from lobby screen directly into the game when countdown reaches zero.

### Easter Egg Feature

* Include a footer with: `¬© 2025. Started with ‚ù§Ô∏è using [caffeine.ai](https://caffeine.ai) Extended with Humans + Claude Code`
* When any user **double-clicks the heart icon (‚ù§Ô∏è)** in the footer:

  * The heart changes to a black heart emoji (üñ§).
  * The current round starts immediately, **bypassing the countdown timer**.
  * Future rounds continue on their original 3-hour schedule.
  * Works for any user, regardless of authentication status.

### Test Mode Configuration

* Include a backend configuration setting (boolean flag or environment variable) that enables test mode when set to `true`.
* When test mode is enabled during deployment:

  * Automatically reset and reinitialize all trivia data and round state.
  * Clear all historical data, player records, round states (fresh state).
* The setting is checked **only during backend initialization and deployment**, not during runtime.
